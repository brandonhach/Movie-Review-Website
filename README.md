# Movie Review custom server using Java Springboot & MongoDB

This project was built over the Spring of 2023. 


- Java Spring is used to create API controllers where incoming HTTP requests will be handled.
- The service layer handles database operations that allow users to write, edit, or delete their code as well as store it in the database.
- The repository layer directly interacts with my personal mongoDB repository which is currently offline. So I will need to find a way to host it.
- `MovieRepository.java`
- `MovieService.java`
- `MovieController.java`
- `ReviewService.java`
- `ReviewRepository.java`
- `ReviewController.java`
- Used Postman to check whether the endpoint works (GET or POST request).
